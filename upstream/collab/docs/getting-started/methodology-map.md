# AI-DLC Terms, Mapped to the Platform

The upstream [AI-DLC methodology](https://github.com/awslabs/aidlc-workflows) ships as markdown files and CLI tools with its own vocabulary. This platform implements the same methodology — but as a collaborative product, so several terms show up under different names or behind different buttons.

Use this page as a translation table: if you know AI-DLC, it tells you where each concept lives here; if you're new, it doubles as a plain-language tour of the methodology.

The sections below walk through the same mapping in the order you meet it as a user.

## Starting work

### Intent

Unchanged in meaning: an intent is one piece of work — a prompt plus a projection of the workflow to run for it. Upstream you type `/aidlc <prompt>`; here you press **New Intent**, enter a title and prompt (or import a tracker issue), and land on the **compose page**. Details: [Creating intents](../using-the-platform/creating-intents.md).

Everything on the compose page is **collaborative** — teammates who open the same draft edit the prompt and the stage selection together, live.

### Scope

Identical concept: a scope (like `feature` or `bugfix`) decides **which stages execute** for this intent. Upstream stores scopes as markdown files with keyword lists; here they are Scope blocks in the [block library](../concepts/workflows-and-blocks.md), and the compose page offers them in a picker.

### The composer — "Compose with AI"

Upstream v2 calls this **Adaptive Workflows**: a composer agent that proposes the projection that fits your task instead of making you pick one. Here it is the **Compose** button:

1. **Deterministic first.** If your prompt cleanly matches exactly one scope's keywords (say, "hotfix" → `bugfix`), the platform answers instantly with no AI call — the same keyword routing upstream does. An administrator can turn this bypass off (Admin → _Composer_), forcing every compose through the agent.
2. **The composer agent otherwise.** The AI reads your prompt, the compiled run shapes of every stock scope, and (optionally) your steering instructions, then proposes either a stock scope (_matched_) or a custom stage grid (_custom_), with a rationale per skipped stage.
3. **You decide.** A proposal is never applied automatically. It shows the _validated_ run shape — real numbers from the plan compiler, not the AI's claims — and you press **Apply proposal** (or ignore it).

### Composed stage grid — "Stages to run"

Upstream custom scopes are new markdown files plus a grid entry; upstream separately supports deselecting individual CONDITIONAL stages at creation. Here both collapse into **one surface**: open **Stages to run** on the compose page and check or uncheck any stage, grouped by phase. Rules the platform enforces for you:

- **Initialization stages always run** (they set up the workspace) — they are locked in the editor.
- Every change is **re-validated instantly**: the run-shape summary updates, and a selection that would starve a stage of its required inputs blocks Start with a clear error.
- Skipped stages' outputs are treated as **absent by design** downstream — agents never invent them.
- Picking a stock scope again discards your customization; **reset to scope** does the same from the editor.

### Compose from a report

Upstream's _report compose_ (`/aidlc compose --report`) triages an external analysis report — for example a code-scanner export — into a compact fix-and-ship run. Here: press the upload button next to _Compose_, pick a JSON report, and the composer proposes a projection that addresses its findings.

### Run-shape summary

Upstream's `validate-grid` prints "N of T stages, G approval gates". Here that exact summary — computed by the same plan compiler that will run the intent — appears live under the scope picker: **"Runs 24 of 32 stages · 18 approval gates"**. What you confirm is what runs.

## Steering a running intent

### Gates

Upstream stages stop and print numbered options in the terminal. Here every stop is a **gate** in the intent view: structured questions with options and free-text, validation gates with **Approve** / **Request changes**, and engine gates (skeleton and batch reviews, autonomy choice, failure handling) that carry the same approve / request-changes loop. A parked intent consumes **zero compute** until someone answers — and gates are answered collaboratively, with shared drafts and steering notes.

Validation gates also name the **computed next stage** ("approve to continue to code-generation"), never a guess — same as upstream 2.2.6.

### Skip to stage X

An approved validation gate can jump ahead: pick a later stage from the skip select and every skippable stage in between is marked skipped. Same rules as upstream — only CONDITIONAL stages can be jumped over, and the target stage always runs in full.

### Reshape (in-flight recompose)

Upstream's in-flight recompose lets you flip pending stages while a workflow runs. Here it lives in two places, matched to how big the change is:

- **Right on the review gate** — while reviewing a stage's results, open **Reshape upcoming stages**, check the optional stages the results made unnecessary, and they are dropped **with your approval**: applied in place, the run keeps going, nothing relaunches.
- **The Reshape remaining stages panel** on the intent view (parked or failed runs) — for bigger changes: **Ask composer** (the agent sees the live progress and proposes flips for pending stages only) or **edit the grid by hand** with everything that already ran locked. Applying **relaunches** the run at the first not-yet-done stage.

Either way the past is frozen: completed stages stay completed, and un-skipping something that already got skipped is the job of…

### Rewind

…the **rewind**: restart the run from an earlier stage, optionally with corrective guidance the restarted stage receives. Rewinding to a stage you deselected at creation un-skips it — upstream calls this "Add Skipped Stage".

One guardrail applies everywhere, exactly as upstream: while construction runs **autonomously**, reshaping is disabled — let the swarm finish or drop back to gated first.

## Construction at scale

### Units of work and lanes

Upstream's Bolt swarm becomes **unit lanes**: the methodology decomposes construction into units of work with a dependency graph, a human approves the fan-out on the unit-plan stage's review gate (one gate covers the artifact and the fan-out decisions), and then each unit runs in its own agent session, workspace, and git branch. The **unit lane board** in the intent view shows every lane's live state.

- The **walking skeleton** — the foundational unit — runs solo first, with its own approval gate. Request changes with feedback and the lane re-runs, then the gate asks again.
- Then you make the **autonomy choice** once: run the remaining lanes fully autonomously, or gate every batch. Batch gates carry the same approve / request-changes loop, with an accept-as-is escape hatch after three revision cycles.
- The engine merges finished lanes back **deterministically**, in dependency order. No AI decides scheduling.

## Quality and memory

### Sensors, reviewer, human validation

The three verification axes are identical to upstream:

1. **Sensors** — deterministic scripted checks after each stage (advisory or blocking).
2. **Reviewer** — a clean-room reviewer agent rendering READY / NOT-READY with bounded retries.
3. **Human validation** — the approval gate on every non-initialization stage.

All three surface in the intent view per stage, with the sensor detail explaining any non-pass verdict.

### Rules, learnings, knowledge

Upstream's memory files (`org.md` → `team.md` → `project.md` plus phase rules) are **Rule blocks** on the layered chain `org → team → project → phase → stage`, attached to workflows. **Learnings** — corrections agents record during runs — accrue as learning rules on the project graph and are injected into every later relevant stage, so nothing gets re-explained. **Knowledge** blocks carry each agent persona's methodology expertise, and **team knowledge** accrues alongside at runtime.

### Agent tiers

Upstream authors each agent with a work-shaped tier — `judgment`, `balanced`, or `templated` — and projects it to a concrete model per tool. Here the same tiers map to models in the Admin (or project) model settings, so a templated planner never burns your most expensive model.

## What you never have to touch

Some upstream machinery has no user-facing counterpart here because the platform does it for you:

| Upstream mechanism                          | Here                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| The conductor / forwarding loop             | A durable execution engine drives the plan; you only ever see gates and the timeline                           |
| Markdown state file + audit log             | The process store and the intent **timeline** ([observability](../using-the-platform/intent-observability.md)) |
| Workspace detection / scaffolding stages    | Run automatically as the first (initialization) stages of every intent                                         |
| `aidlc doctor`                              | Plan validation happens **before** an intent can start; problems are synchronous, explained errors             |
| Manual git (branches, commits, merges, PRs) | Engine-owned: branches per intent and per lane, commits after every stage, the PR at fan-in                    |
