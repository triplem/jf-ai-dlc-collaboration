/**
 * Set-based sequence deduplicator for WebSocket event streams.
 *
 * acp-client stamps every streamed event with a monotonically increasing
 * `seq`; events can arrive duplicated across reconnects. Each event TYPE gets
 * its own instance so a tool event with seq=5 doesn't cause a chunk with
 * seq=4 to be dropped.
 *
 * Extracted from useAgentStatus so the discussion assist stream
 * shares the exact same dedupe semantics.
